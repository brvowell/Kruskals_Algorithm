# Kruskals_Algorithm
An Implementation of Kruskal's Algorithm using input from a file

To run the program, one must provide a file from which to read edge values.
A '-r' option is available to specify the root needed to run the algorithm.
If no root is specified, the first vertex read in will be set as the root.

An example of correct formating for the input file can be found in '100k'.
